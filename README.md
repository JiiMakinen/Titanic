# Titanic
Predicting if a passenger would have survived with machine learning.

First data analysis project with Python, so this will be a learning project for me.

Data provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) from the "Titanic - Machine learning from disaster" -competition.

train.csv will be used to train our machine.
test.csv will be used to test our machine.

Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
